	<div class="section">The Web</div>  The web works using the following elements html, the internet, http and server. Essential it is a vast number of computers in a network talking to each other. 
	When a user connects to a website they make a request to a server via http, <em>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.</em> The server searches for relevant HTML to send back to the user's computer. This is then displayed on the users screen via a web browser which can interpret the data.

<div class="section">HTML Basics</div>
	<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp"> Here </a> is a great starting point for HTML resources and details on the vocabulary. Tags are always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag and a closing tag. Void tags do not require a closing tag. Elements within html refer to everything within a set of opening and closing tags. HTML elements can be inline or block. Block essential means there is an invisible box around it. A paragraph tag is an example of a block element. Attributes are properties of html elements, eg the href attribute of an anchor tag to the URL for google
</p>

<p>
	<div class="section">The Code</div> These are the instructions a programmer creates to enable a computer to run programmes and tasks in a syntax it understands.Computers can be said to be stupid as they need to follow this syntax exactly. There can be no general interpretations of what the computer thinks the programmer may mean. The computer is very unforgiving to any mistakes the programmer may make in their code. Programmers will struggle to remember all the details of a given code language variant but this is fine as there is a wealth of resources online.

<div class="banner">The Tools and Adding Structure</div>
<div class ="description">
	
<p>
	<div class="section">Developer Tools</div> Some browsers such as Google chrome and Mozilla firefox have developer tools built in. These allow the users to inspect webpages and individual elements within them to understand how they are structured.
</p>

<p>
	<div class="section">DOM</div> DOM stands for Document Object Model. It details how a website is structured, like an organisation chart within a company. It shows the relationship elements within an html document have with each other. Elements can be within elements.
</p>

<p>
	<div class="section">Boxes boxes everywhere</div> The elements contained within an html document and the tree like structure are shown as boxes in a browser. Even if they dont appear to be box-like shapes to the naked eye, trust me they are. This is key to the structuring of a webpage.

<div class="banner">Style it up!</div>
<div class ="description">
<p>
	
	<div class="section">CSS</div> CSS, cascading style sheet, is code written to control the style of HTML elements. Using CSS can save a considerable amount of time by avoiding repetition in grouping styles together. There can be multiple conflicting style rules within CSS effecting the same elements, however the most specific/granual level will always have priority.
</p>

<p>
	There are three methods to styling:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Write style inline with your HTML.<em> This is poor form!</em></li>
  <li>Write CSS in the < head > of your HTML.<em> This is ok for small projects</em></li>
    <li>Link your HTML to a separate CSS file. <em><b>This is best practise!</b></em></li>
    </ul>
 </div>
